usage: How to use the command line options:
 -a,--args <argument>        Script arguments. If multiple scripts are
                             run, they will all be run with these
                             arguments. If there are multiple script
                             arguments, they must be space-separated.
                             Example: -a arg1 arg2 arg3
 -e,--engine <engine name>   Engine name for the script to use. If
                             multiple scripts are run, they will all be
                             run with this engine. The engine needs to be
                             already installed. Some available engines:
                             Jython
                             Py4j
                             Rhino
                             Nashorn
 -h,--help                   Shows the help.
 -s,--script <script>        Run a script once the workspace is ready
