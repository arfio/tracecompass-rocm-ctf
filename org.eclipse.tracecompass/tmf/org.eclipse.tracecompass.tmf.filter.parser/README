This file describes how to build the IElementResolver Filter Java parser files. They are stored in
the git repository (to avoid additional compile-time dependencies), but if you
do modify the .g files in src/, you should rebuild the resulting .java files and
commit them.

To rebuild the parser files, run Maven with the "filter" profile, as such:
$ mvn clean install -Pfilter-grammar
